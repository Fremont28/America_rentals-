A report on U.S. rentals 

Over 2017 and 2018, one-bedroom rentals increased by an average 2.4% across fifteen largest markets in the U.S. This includes hot trending markets like Austin (+4.9%) and Denver (+3.5) but also lesser known hubs such as Baltimore (+8.4) and Charlotte (+4.7).

Denver is also one of the fastest growing U.S. markets spiking 54% between 2010 and 2018 (through February). In 2017, the average one bedroom rental in Denver hovered around $1548, which by New York and Californian prices is a relative bargain. However, the upper end of 95% confidence interval price could jump to $1804 over the next 12 months and $1889 over the next 24 months.Â
